  * Modify the AJAX data adapter and search box so that items are read out when moving up and
    down through them with the keyboard
  * Link select2 instances to the label(s) of the original <select>
  * Allow removing tags with the keyboard

  * Keep focus position when loading more elements with infinite scrolling
  * Add label to "Remove tag" button
