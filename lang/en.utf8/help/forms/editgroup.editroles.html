<h3>Editing group content</h3>
<p>You can choose which roles will be allowed to create and edit pages, journals and files owned by the group. Permissions can be changed on individual files in the group files area.</p>

<p>If your group contains only members and administrators, then "Group administrators" and "Everyone except members" are identical.</p>
